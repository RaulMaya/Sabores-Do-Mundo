        ingredients : "1 pork shoulder, 3-4 pounds / 4 tablespoons salt / 4-6 garlic cloves, peeled / 1 tablespoon cumin seeds / 1 tablespoon black peppercorns / 1 teaspoon whole allspice / 1 tablespoon red-chile powder / ½ teaspoon whole cloves / ½ teaspoon cinnamon powder / 1 tablespoon Mexican oregano / 4 tablespoons achiote-seed paste / 1 orange, zested and juiced / 1 grapefruit, zested and juiced / 1 lime, juiced / 2 banana leaves, wiped clean / ½ white onion, thinly sliced",
        steps : `1. Score the fat of the pork, evenly salt the meat and set it aside while you make the marinade. In a dry saucepan over medium heat, toast the garlic cloves until they’re charred all over, then remove. In the same pan, add cumin, peppercorns, allspice, red-chile powder, cloves and cinnamon. Toast until you can really smell the cumin and pepper. Grind spices, and mix in a food processor until smooth with the oregano, charred garlic, achiote paste, all the citrus zest and about half the juice.
        2. Place two overlapping banana leaves on your work surface, and put the pork at the center. Rub the spice paste all over the meat, arrange the sliced white onion on top and roll the whole thing up, folding the sides like wrapping paper. (If it unravels, tie it closed with some kitchen twine.) Set the parcel in the fridge for a few hours, or overnight.
        3. Heat oven to 300. Put the parcel on a rack, or a ring of scrunched-up aluminum foil, inside a heavy pot with a half cup of water at the bottom. Bake with the lid on until the meat is very tender and yields easily to a fork, about 4 hours. Meanwhile, mix the chopped red onion with remaining citrus juices, salt and habanero, and set aside.
        4. While the meat is still warm, carefully transfer the parcel to a serving dish. Use a fork to shred the meat, spoon over the cooking juices and mix well. Serve with pickled onions, warmed tortillas and halved limes.`,

        steps : `1. Make the picadillo: Heat olive oil in a large skillet over high. Spread pork in an even layer and cook, undisturbed, until lightly browned, about 3 minutes. Toss and continue to cook, breaking up meat with the back of a spoon and scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan, until meat is crumbled and lightly browned, 4 to 6 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the browned meat to a large bowl and set aside.
        2. Reduce heat to medium and cook onion, apple, pear, plantain, garlic and 1½ tablespoons kosher salt, stirring occasionally, until tender but not browned, 10 to 12 minutes, adjusting the heat as necessary.

Add the cooked pork, olives, lemon zest and 1 cup water, and cook, stirring occasionally, until all the liquid has evaporated, the vegetables and fruit are tender and the pork is cooked through, 10 to 15 minutes. Stir in the parsley and lemon juice, season with salt and pepper, and set aside until ready to use.
        5. Meanwhile, fry the poblanos: Heat vegetable oil in a large saucepan fitted with a deep-fry thermometer on high until thermometer registers 375 degrees. Working in four batches, fry the poblanos, turning once, until skin is opaque and blistered, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Transfer poblanos to a large, heatproof bowl, wrap tightly with plastic and let sit 15 minutes. When cool enough to handle, peel skin from chiles, leaving stem intact. Chiles should still be firm and bright green. Using a paring knife, make a 2-inch cut (about 1 inch from the top) lengthwise down the side of each poblano and carefully remove seeds and ribs.
        6. Place the poblanos cut-side up on a rimmed baking sheet and fill each with about ½ cup picadillo, gently pressing the filling into the poblanos with the back of a spoon, until full but not bursting or splitting. Set aside.
        7. Make the sauce: Purée the walnuts, almonds, crème fraîche and queso fresco with 1¼ cups water and ¾ teaspoon salt in a blender until creamy. Season with salt and thin with more water, if necessary.

        steps : `1. Cut the pork belly in 5-6 mm thick slices - then dry the slices on kitchen roll towel for a while. Season the slices with salt and pepper before frying.
        2. Start peeling the potatoes. Put them in a pot - and cover them with cold water. Boil the potatoes for 15-20 minutes. You can leave the skin on - if you prefer. Especially ""new"" potatoes of the season with very thin tender - white skin. Chop the parsley into pieces.Some parsley for the sauce and some for decoration.
        3. Make a butter ball of butter and flour and stir continuously - while melting in the sauce pot - and until the mixture is turned into a consistent mass. Ad little milk and stir. Do not boil the sauce. Repeat until the sauce has the consistency that you favour. Not to thick and not to light. You will end up having prepared a kind of white “béchamel sauce”. Add the whipping cream and taste the sauce. Put nutmeg in - if preferred. Then add all the chopped parsley - and season to taste with salt and pepper - while stirring. Let the sauce simmer for 5-10 minutes - so the ingredients are stirred and mixed together - while sucking up flavour.
        4. Fry the pork belly slices for almost 2 minutes on each side on a hot pan with moderate heat until they seam crispy and with a golden surface. Dry them again on kitchen roll towel - where some of the fat can drain - and keep the fried pork belly slices warm in an oven until serving.
        5. One can also put the pork belly in the heated 200° oven and fry for 20 minutes - while turning the slices after half the roasting time. In the summertime it is quicker to grill the pork belly slices on a well heated charcoal grill.
        6. Put the lukewarm potatoes on a warm plate - arrange the fried pork belly strips - then pour the warm temperate parsley sauce over the potatoes. Sprinkle some fresh chopped parsley over the dish - and serve.`,

        steps : `To prepare lasagna bolognese, start with the ragù. Prepare the vegetable broth and keep it warm. Then take the pancetta and cut it into thin strips. Finely chop it with a knife or a mezzaluna. Separately, prepare a fine mixture with carrots, onions, celery, and set it aside. In a saucepan, pour a drizzle of oil and add the pancetta. Stir it well with a ladle and let it brown for a few minutes. Then add the vegetable mixture and let it cook for 5-6 minutes. Add the ground meat and raise the heat. Let the meat brown without hurry; it should be well-browned to seal the juices and become soft, not tough. Deglaze with the red wine, then wait for it to evaporate completely and add the tomato puree. Stir; the ragù must cook for two hours. When it resumes boiling, you can add a little hot broth, one or two ladles. Then let the ragù cook for at least a couple of hours. You must cook it with the lid on, but not completely closed. Check and stir occasionally, add more broth if necessary, and let it cook for the indicated time. Now move on to the pasta. First, pour the spinach into a pan, add a little water, cover with a lid and cook until wilted, about 5-6 minutes. Drain, let them cool, and squeeze them well. Transfer them to a mixer and blend them until you get a puree. You must get 100 g of it. Now, on a pastry board, pour the semolina and 00 flour, add the spinach and create a well shape. Add the lightly beaten eggs and yolks. Start kneading everything from the center; this way, the eggs won't slip out of the well. Knead well until you get a homogeneous ball. Wrap it in plastic wrap and let it rest for 30 minutes at room temperature. Meanwhile, prepare the béchamel sauce, always remembering to check the ragù. Heat the milk in a saucepan without boiling it. In another pan, melt the butter, add the flour all at once and cook for a few minutes until you get a golden roux. Then pour the hot milk in 3 times, stirring well. Add salt and flavor with nutmeg. Keep stirring until you get a creamy béchamel. Transfer to a bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and set aside. As soon as the 30 minutes have passed, take the ball of pasta and take a piece. Cover the remaining pasta with plastic wrap to keep it from drying out. Flatten it slightly on the pastry board, forming a rectangle and pass it through the pasta maker, starting from a thicker setting. Fold the pasta onto itself and pass it through the pasta maker again. When it becomes too moist, sprinkle it with a little semolina. Gradually reduce the thickness until you get a sheet that is just over half a millimeter thick. Transfer it to a pastry board and cut rectangles of 30x20 cm. Proceed in this way until you finish the dough, and in the meantime, put a pot of water on the stove and salt it. When it starts boiling, dip one sheet at a time, wait for 30-40 seconds and drain it with a slotted spoon. 34 Transfer it onto a tray with a kitchen towel and pat it to remove excess water. Continue in this way by placing the cooked sheets side by side without overlapping them. As soon as the ragù is ready 36, adjust the salt and pepper and proceed to the composition of the lasagna. Take a large lasagna dish measuring 30x20 cm and butter the bottom 37. Add a thin layer of béchamel sauce and one of ragù 38. Then place the first sheet 39, add a layer of béchamel sauce and one of ragù 40. Add grated Parmesan cheese 41 and place another pasta sheet 42 on top. Add another layer of béchamel sauce and one of ragù 43, add grated cheese 44 and continue in this way until you have 5 layers. After placing the last sheet, add the ragù 45 so that it covers the pasta completely 46. Sprinkle with grated cheese, add small pieces of butter 47 and bake in a preheated static oven at 170°C for 40 minutes. The Bolognese lasagna is ready to be served 48.`,

        steps : `To prepare ricotta and spinach ravioli, start by making fresh egg pasta dough. Place the flour (you can reserve about 50 g to add as needed) in a bowl and add the beaten eggs. Mix the ingredients well with your hands to create a homogeneous dough. If the dough is too dry, add warm water to make it softer and easier to roll out with a rolling pin or pasta machine. If the dough is too sticky, add the reserved flour gradually. Transfer the dough to a work surface and knead it vigorously until you obtain a smooth and homogeneous dough. Shape it into a ball and wrap it in transparent food wrap. Let the dough rest for 30 minutes, protected from light and drafts that could dry it out. Meanwhile, prepare the filling: take a large non-stick frying pan and add the rinsed spinach, covering it with a lid to wilt. Let it cook until it is soft, which should take about a couple of minutes. When the spinach is soft, drain it to eliminate excess liquid and set it aside. Take a large bowl and mix the ricotta and Parmesan cheese. Flavor with nutmeg and, using a whisk, mix the ingredients to combine them. Adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper. Once combined, chop the spinach in a blender and add it to the ricotta mixture. Mix the ingredients well to obtain a homogeneous mixture. Transfer the mixture to a pastry bag and set it aside. At this point, the dough will have rested. Divide it into two portions. Leave one portion wrapped in plastic wrap to prevent it from drying out, and lightly dust the other with semolina flour (which will not be absorbed into the dough). Roll out the dough using a pasta machine, starting with the thickest setting and gradually decreasing to the second thinnest setting, until you obtain a rectangular sheet about 1mm thick. Repeat the process with the other portion of dough. Place the two sheets on a work surface lightly dusted with semolina flour and create small mounds of filling using the pastry bag. Arrange the mounds about 3 cm apart from each other, spraying water on the edges of the pasta (or you can also brush them with a kitchen brush) so that, when you place the second sheet on top of the first, it will easily stick. Make sure to release the air between each ravioli by pressing around the filling with your fingers, so that they do not open during cooking, causing the filling to come out. When you place the second sheet on top of the first, make sure to align the edges. Then, using a serrated pastry wheel, cut the ravioli into 4x4 cm squares. You should get about 24 ravioli, which you will place on a tray lightly dusted with semolina flour. Your ricotta and spinach ravioli are now ready! You can cook them in boiling water and season them to taste, for example with butter and sage!`,

After resting, give it a small fold: imagine the sphere is divided into four parts, take the end of each one, pull it gently, and fold it towards the center. Once you have made the four folds, flip it onto itself and shape it into a sphere. Transfer the dough into a bowl, cover it with plastic wrap, and let it rise. For convenience, you can put the bowl in the oven (turned off but with the light on), so the inside will reach a temperature of 26-28°C, ideal for rising. Alternatively, you can also keep the bowl in a warm place. The times are approximate since each dough, temperature, and weather conditions affect the rising: on average, the dough should take 6 hours to double in volume. After the rising time, the dough will be beautifully puffy, so transfer it onto the work surface and divide it into 3 pieces of 265g each. If you need to, lightly flour the work surface. Now take each portion and, as before, lift a flap of dough and bring it towards the center. Repeat the same operation for the other 3 flaps of dough. Flip the dough and proceed with "pirlatura": rotating the dough with your hands on the work surface, bringing it towards you, and then repeatedly pushing it away until you obtain a smooth and regular sphere. Transfer the dough balls into a greased pizza box and cover them with its lid. Let them rest for another 30 minutes. Meanwhile, place the refractory stone in the oven and set it to 250°C with static mode. Now, using a tarocco (a special tool used in Italy to move the pizza around), gently lift the first dough ball. Transfer it to a surface with plenty of semolina and add a little more semolina on top. Using your fingertips, press the dough in the center and make a rotating movement to enlarge it. Never press the edges, and continue until you obtain a 28 cm disk. Transfer the dough onto the pizza peel, being careful not to ruin it. Now, using a spoon, spread the tomato sauce on the pizza, leaving a border. Bake it, sliding the pizza gently onto the refractory stone, and let it cook for about 6 minutes. In the meantime, cut the mozzarella into sticks or shred it by hand. You can gently squeeze it so that it does not release too much water when cooked. After 6 minutes, using the pizza peel, remove the pizza from the oven. Add the mozzarella sticks on top and bake it for another 6 minutes. When it is well browned, remove it from the oven, add the basil leaves, and enjoy!`,

        steps : `To prepare the classic carbonara, you need to bring a large pot of water to boil. As soon as the water reaches boiling point, add the spaghetti and let them cook until 2 minutes before the end of the cooking time. Cut the guanciale (cured pork cheek) into thick slices of about 4 mm, and then cut these slices into strips that are approximately 1 cm wide. Put the guanciale in a pan and brown it over medium heat. Meanwhile, crush some black pepper in a mortar. In a bowl, combine the egg yolks, pecorino cheese, and crushed pepper. Mix well until you obtain a homogeneous mixture and set aside. When the guanciale is crispy, drain the pasta (al dente) and add it to the pan with the guanciale. Add two ladles of cooking water and mix well to emulsify. Turn off the heat and add the egg and pecorino mixture and another ladle of cooking water. Start stirring to melt the egg with the water. Mix well and add a couple more ladles of cooking water, continuing to stir until you obtain a creamy emulsion. Then, plate the pasta and finish with a sprinkle of black pepper and, if desired, some grated pecorino cheese. Your classic carbonara is now ready!`,

Slowly pour in the remaining half and half and the whole milk, while whisking constantly, until combined and smooth. 5 Continue to heat over medium heat, whisking very often, until thickened to a very thick consistency. It should almost be the consistency of a semi thinned out condensed soup. 6 Remove from the heat and stir in spices and 1 1/2 cups of the cheeses, stirring to melt and combine. Stir in another 1 1/2 cups of cheese, and stir until completely melted and smooth.7 In a large mixing bowl, combine drained pasta with cheese sauce, stirring to combine fully. Pour half of the pasta mixture into the prepared baking dish. 8 Top with 1 1/2 cups of shredded cheeses, then top that with the remaining pasta mixture. 9 Sprinkle the top with the last 1 1/2 cups of cheese and bake for 15 minutes, until cheesy is bubbly and lightly golden brown.`,
