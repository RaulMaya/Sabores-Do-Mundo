## Project criteria

### Front End(Bootstrap)

By using Bootstrap CSS in our web application, we were able to create a user-friendly and responsive design that enhances the user experience and makes it easy for users to navigate the webpage. The framework allowed us to quickly and easily implement consistent styling across our HTML elements, which greatly reduced the time and effort required to create a visually appealing design.

Overall, the use of Bootstrap CSS in our project was extremely beneficial,as it not only helped us to create a Pleasing and functional design but also helped to make the development process smoother and more efficient.

- Bootstrap code example

<br>

### Back End (Node.js Express.js MySQL Heroku)

By using the npm we can install the packages that we need to simplify our tasks at hand and with the extension of express that is build inside node.js to develop and asign our routes, asssets make a GET-fetch and POST-fetch, helpers as well as designing a fully functional database to store all of our data including our users.

In regard to our users we have an authenticator that allows us to know when they have registered with us so that other users can't use the same mail or username

<br>

### Youtube tool

It allows us to show our users a video of the recipes they are interested in. We redirect them to the most viewed video of that especific plate .
